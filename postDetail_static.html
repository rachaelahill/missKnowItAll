	    <p class="user-posted-txt">Dear Miss Know It All,</p>
	    <p class="user-posted-txt">I have always agreed with the principles that govern the Universal Laws, so the thought that ‘like attracts like’ and ‘what goes around comes around’ resonates with my thinking greatly.<br/><br/>
  	    Universal laws are the basic principles that rule every aspect of the universe and are the ways by which our world and the whole cosmos works, so that when we begin to focus on positive thoughts, we will bring positive results into our life; in the same way as when we begin to focus on negative thoughts we will bring negative results back into our life.<br/><br/>
  	    Unfortunately most of the time the majority of us will go through our lives constantly worrying, whilst we continue to focus on those worries with no let up. As a child I struggled with worries so I can completely resonate… but I know that as we begin to understand the universe and its laws, we will begin to understand how we can change and perceive our lives differently so that we solve our problems with ease without the need for worry.</p>

	    <p class="resp-username">Dear John Smith,</p>
	    <p class="resp-post-txt">Resistance to change is brought about by our inability to accept that the life we had isn’t the life we’ve got now. Any circumstances will always be part of the universal resistance, which means the more we resist, the more we draw those circumstances to us.<br/><br/>
	        Some of us will worry that because we have to deal with change, we will lose control; but it stands to reason that if we have control before the time we have to change, we’ll have control through change and beyond it. For some, change may interfere with their independence, but for others change may mean the total opposite when through new circumstances they become free of their restraints.<br/><br/>
	        We’re only human of course and we’re creatures of habit; we like to follow the same routines and aren’t always good with change. Change isn’t a habit because it’s not something that happens frequently enough and having to work through it can be an uncomfortable experience. Change is about opportunity, growth, spiritually emotionally and physically.</p>
